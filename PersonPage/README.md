# How to get into the Knowledge Panels
Getting key persons of your organization into SERP knowledge panels are not as difficult as one might think. Tell google about new pages by following https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://www.example.com/?url=https://www.website.com/sitemap.xml I would suggest you add an entry to your robots.txt with a line that reads: Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml

When the side panel begins to show for each person, Follow the guidelines at https://brandee.edu.vn/glossary/6325583-websearch-en/ after your Person entities are created and displaying to further tweak them. How much detail you put into the person is up to you. Go to https://schema.org/Person to see things I omitted. Ask in the discussions how to add it.
